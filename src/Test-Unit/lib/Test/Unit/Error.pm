=head1 NAME

Test::Unit::Error - unit testing framework exception class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This class is not intended to be used directly 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used by the framework to communicate the result of
assertions, which will throw an instance of this class in case of
errors (that is, syntax errors and the like, not failed tests, as
these are classified as failures).
