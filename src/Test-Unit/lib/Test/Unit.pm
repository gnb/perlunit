=head1 NAME

Test::Unit - Procedural style unit testing interface

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Unit;

    # your code to be tested goes here

    sub foo { return 23 };
    sub bar { return 42 };

    # define tests

    sub test_foo { assert(foo() == 23, "Your message here"); }	
    sub test_bar { assert(bar() == 42, "I will be printed if this fails"); }

    # set_up and tear_down are used to
    # prepare and release resources need for testing

    sub set_up    { print "hello world\n"; }
    sub tear_down { print "leaving world again\n"; }

    # run your test

    create_suite();
    run_suite();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::Unit is the procedural style interface to a sophisticated unit
testing framework for Perl that is derived from the JUnit testing
framework for Java by Kent Beck and Erich Gamma. While this framework
is originally intended to support unit testing in an object-oriented
development paradigm (with support for inheritance of tests etc.),
Test::Unit is intended to provide a simpler interface to the framework
that is more suitable for use in a scripting style environment.
Therefore, Test::Unit does not provide much support for an
object-oriented approach to unit testing - if you want that, please
have a look at L<Test::Unit::TestCase>.

You test a given unit (a script, a module, whatever) by using
Test::Unit, which exports the following routines into your namespace:

=over 4

=item assert()

used to assert that a boolean condition is true

=item create_suite()

used to create a test suite consisting of all methods with a name
prefix of C<test>

=item run_suite()

runs the test suite (text output)

=item add_suite()

used to add test suites to each other

=back

For convenience, C<create_suite()> will automatically build a test
suite for a given package. This will build a test case for each
subroutine in the package given that has a name starting with C<test>
and pack them all together into one TestSuite object for easy testing.
If you dont give a package name to C<create_suite()>, the current
package is taken as default.

Test output is one status line (a "." for every successful test run,
or an "F" for any failed test run, to indicate progress), one result
line ("OK" or "!!!FAILURES!!!"), and possibly many lines reporting
detailed error messages for any failed tests.

Please remember, Test::Unit is intended to be a simple and convenient
interface. If you need more functionality, take the object-oriented
approach outlined in L<Test::Unit::TestCase>.
