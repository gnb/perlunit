	* doc/consensus.txt: todo: check for broken Error.pms

2001-09-07  pdcawley  <pdcawley@iterative-software.com>

	* ChangeLog: Added some stuff in the ChangeLog

	* lib/Test/Unit/Result.pm: More doc fixes.

	* lib/Test/Unit/Result.pm, lib/Test/Unit/TestCase.pm:
	Doctored Test::Unit::Result again, so that if $test->run_bare *does*
	return false we actually add a failure instead of just leaving things
	up in the air (causes a problem with test harnesses if we don't)

	* lib/Test/Unit/Assert.pm, lib/Test/Unit/TestCase.pm, lib/Test/Unit/tests/AssertTest.pm, ChangeLog:
	Tidied up the documentation in Test::Unit::Assert.
	Made sure that Test::Unit::TestCase::run_bare returns true if it doesn't
	throw an exception.

	* lib/Test/Unit/TestCase.pm: An attempt at improving the documentation.

	* lib/Test/Unit/Setup.pm: New file.

	* Changes, MANIFEST, examples/README, examples/fail_example.pm, lib/Test/Unit/Setup.pm, lib/Test/Unit/TestSetup.pm:
	Renamed Test::Unit::TestSetup to Test::Unit::Setup

	* lib/Test/Unit/Listener.pm, lib/Test/Unit/tests/ListenerTest.pm:
	New file.

	* MANIFEST, lib/Test/Unit/HarnessUnit.pm, lib/Test/Unit/Listener.pm, lib/Test/Unit/TestListener.pm, lib/Test/Unit/TestRunner.pm, lib/Test/Unit/TkTestRunner.pm, lib/Test/Unit/UnitHarness.pm, lib/Test/Unit/tests/AllTests.pm, lib/Test/Unit/tests/ListenerTest.pm, lib/Test/Unit/tests/TestListenerTest.pm:
	Renamed Test::Unit::TestListener to Test::Unit::Listener

	* lib/Test/Unit/Decorator.pm: New file.

	* MANIFEST, lib/Test/Unit/Decorator.pm, lib/Test/Unit/TestDecorator.pm, lib/Test/Unit/TestSetup.pm:
	Renamed Test::Unit::TestDecorator to Test::Unit::Decorator

	* lib/Test/Unit/Loader.pm: New file.

	* ChangeLog, MANIFEST, lib/Test/Unit/HarnessUnit.pm, lib/Test/Unit/Loader.pm, lib/Test/Unit/TestListener.pm, lib/Test/Unit/TestLoader.pm, lib/Test/Unit/TkTestRunner.pm:
	Renamed Test::Unit::TestLoader to Test::Unit::Loader

2001-09-07  Piers Cawley  <pdcawley@iterative-software.com>

	* lib/Test/Unit/TestCase.pm
	(run_bare): Made sure it returns true if it doesn't throw an exception.

	* lib/Test/Unit/tests/AssertTest.pm
	(test_fail_assert_not_equals): 
	(test_success_assert_not_equals): Added tests for assert_not_equals.

	* lib/Test/Unit/Assert.pm 
	Doc fixes.
	(assert_not_equals): Aadded the option to assert that things
	aren't equal. Also added appropriate
	(assert_(str|num)_not_equals) methods.

2001-09-02  Piers Cawley  <pdcawley@iterative-software.com>

	* lib/Test/Unit/Loader.pm
	(load): Improved the error message when a file can be found, but
	has a syntax error.

	* lib/Test/Unit/TestFailure.pm:
	Removed.

	* lib/Test/Unit/InnerClass.pm:
	Removed
	
	* lib/Test/Unit/tests/AssertTest.pm 
	Switched to a ResultsMatrix style of testing. Seems to work quite
	well... 

	* lib/Test/Unit/Assert.pm
	(is_numeric): Got rid of warnings when the argument isn't numeric.

	* t/all_tests.t: 
	* t/assert_test.t:
	Got rid of C<use lib '../lib'> since blib should be handling that.

	* lib/Test/Unit/tests/TestTest.pm: 
	Basic refactoring to use Class::Inner.
	(make_dummy_testcase): New helper method to make anonymous
	classes used in many of the tests.

	* lib/Test/Unit/Assertion/Boolean.pm
	(do_assertion): Switched to a slightly more sensible way of
	generating failure messages.

	* lib/Test/Unit/Loader.pm
	(load): Changed the order in which we call C<try_test_suite> and
	C<try_test_case>. 

	* lib/Test/Unit/TestResult.pm: 
	Removed dependency on Test::Unit::TestFailure.

	* lib/Test/Unit/ExceptionError.pm
	(make_from_error_simple): Fixed things up slightly. This method
	maybe needs a leading underscore; Framework users should probably
	never see it...

	* lib/Test/Unit/Assertion.pm
	(fail): Fixed things to put appropriate information into the
	thrown exception.

	* lib/Test/Unit/Assert.pm: 
	General refactoring work to get things working with the CPAN
	modules. 
	(assert): Now, when an exception is generated, we try and get the
	appropriate caller information for setting -line and -file. Which
	is nice.
	(assert_equals): Fixed to use try/catch. Fixed a nasty bug with @_
	getting silently emptied via try, so now, before we call try, we
	copy @_ to @args and use that inside the closure, otherwise
	assert_equals would always return true.
	(assert_str_equals,assert_num_equals,assert_null,assert_not_null):
	All now set $Error::Depth correctly.

	* lib/Test/Unit/Exception.pm
	(stringify): Tidied up stringification.
	(failed_test, thrown_exception): We now conform to the
	Test::Unit::TestFailure interface. Which means that we can get rid
	of Test::Unit::TestFailure itself. Which is nice.

	* lib/Test/Unit.pm:
	Switched to using Devel::Symdump, Class::Inner and Error
	(assert): Moved to the try/catch style.
	(create_suite): Vaguely major refactoring. Switched to using
	Devel::Symdump and Class::Inner instead of the hand rolled symbol
	table manipulation and Test::Unit::InnerClass
