[revised]

   Commit new files in src/Test-Unit-0.1 including
 
    - Changes (section for release at the top)
 
    - Makefile.PL (set new $VERSION)
 
    - README (Version numbers on installation commands .. surely we
      could put something generic in here?)

    - MANIFEST if files are to be added to the tarball
 
   cvs rtag -r HEAD REL_0_14 releasemodule

   cvs exp -r REL_0_14 -d Test-Unit-n.nn src/Test-Unit-0.1
 
   make clean ; perl Makefile.PL ; make tardist

   (upload to incoming as per Sourceforge docs)


As for the CPAN stuff, is this complicated? Presumably the significant
changes are documented in ExtUtils::MakeMaker?

Also, since there's filtering via MANIFEST, is there any need to
'export' instead of running from a checked out working copy? Could
Makefile.PL enquire of CVS or the top of the Changes file which
version we're releasing?

I'm thinking about reducing the number of things that need trivial
tweaks before making a release.

So we've a solution to this separate problem, but perhaps we should
hold off the feature creep until we've got more tests in?

(any bright ideas for ways to tie the docs to the tests so the can
fail a test when we tweak things? I'm just about to digress hugely so
I'll save it for another post)

Would suit me too, since ATM we've no way to backtrace to a release.
Only thing is, if you can release a checked out copy, the export is a
little wasteful. <shrug>

No. You can just run from a checked out working copy.
At least that was what I did until now.

Cheers,

Christian
