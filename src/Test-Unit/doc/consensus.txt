-*- outline -*-

* Intro

We were wondering how we should go about keeping track of the
consensuses (sp?) we reached on the perlunit-devel mailing list.

Matthew was all for a cumbersome set of tags so we could grep the list
for "points".

Christian suggested a simple text file in CVS which we modify as
appropriate.

This is a compromise - a simple text file marked up for use with
emacs' "outline-mode". I chose this because I know that at least 2/4
active developers use emacs. Open to other suggestions of course.

** Links back to the mailing list

Might be handy for those with local archives, but dropping message-ids
in this file will make a mess IMHO  -- mca

* Test::Unit::Assert::assert()

** assert_eq(this, that, message) and other comparison routines

PerlUnit doesn't include these because the user should be left to
decide for s/himself whether to use == or eq .

For the same reason we suggest users should roll their own structure
comparison routines or use FreezeThaw::cmpStr()

Having said this, we don't have concrete examples of Bad Things
happening, as Adam pointed out. Please add examples below...

** assert_regexp(string, qr/regexp/, message)

seems like a good idea, not yet implemented? -- mca

** coderef_assert($cr, $self);

Write some stuff Piers! I'm a bit baffled -- mca

* Test::Unit::TestSuite, auto-adding tests

** interaction with inheritance

Broken in v0.13, it will take SUPER::test_foo if test_foo is
an inheritted method in the class being scanned.

Hopefully being fixed by Piers?

** regexps to pull functions called /^test/

I think current consensus is to change the default to /^test[_A-Z]/
but make it configurable.

I seem to have lost that thread -- mca

* Debug methods

Not much agreement yet, here are some of the suggestions

** $self->debug()

A dead/unused patch from Matthew, the idea was a default debug in the
base T:U:TestCase class and methods to override it. Messy and
inconvenient.

** $self->listener->debug($@)

Some say listeners are Java-ish. Others say that they're good anyway.
9-)

Arguments are headed towards something like
       debug( level => 123,
	      user => "simple message",
	      developer => "complicated message" );
or some variation on the theme.

This all looks rather verbose so far though. 8-(

** clever things with caller()

one vote for [MCA] (provided you can override it)
one vote against? [PDC]

* Documentation

Where should it be kept? At the moment it lives almost entirely in POD
and mailing list/message board format, and so is inaccessible.

A pod2html pass of released software should probably be served on the
website.

Matthew's (almost finished) cvspublish.pl script could do most of this
but is probably overkill. Also it doesn't grok MANIFEST files.

There is a documentation manager on SF. The front door is not too
friendly and there is no back door to the data inside it.

* Generic tests for users to include

Matthew wrote some. Whether anyone else wants them remains to be seen.

* Test coverage tests

There was a big thread on this but it's someone else's turn to write
about that. 8-)  -- mca

* Namespace pollution

We're going to try to avoid it while generating "inner classes" or
whatever, for the self-tests.

* Test::Unit::tests that need adding

** die errors that look like variable names  [mca]

A test that fails with an error like

  die '$lotsofdollars';

and make sure it gets wrapped into an ExceptionError
