# PerlUnit was originally written as a port of Kent Beck and Erich
# Gamma's xUnit testing framework by Christian Lemburg and Brian
# Ewins, and is now maintained by Piers Cawley and the rest of the
# PerlUnit team. 
#
# The following is an alphabetical list of all the people who've
# contributed code and effort to making PerlUnit what it is today.
# Where possible we have included their preferred email addresses
#
# The use of this database for anything other than PerlUnit
# development is strictly forbidden. (Passive distribution with the
# PerlUnit source code package is naturally allowed)
